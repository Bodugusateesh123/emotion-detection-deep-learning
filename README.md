# emotion-detection-deep-learning
Real-time emotion detection system using deep learning techniques for analyzing facial expressions in live video streams.


## Overview
This project implements a real-time emotion detection system using deep learning techniques. It utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained on facial expression images to predict the emotions of individuals in a live video stream.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Keras
- Numpy

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
       git clone https://github.com/your_username/emotion-detection.git

2. Install the required dependencies:
      pip install opencv-python keras numpy

## Usage
1.Navigate to the project directory:
    cd emotion-detection
   
2.Run the main script:
    python main.py
    
3.A live video stream will open, detecting and displaying emotions in real-time.

## Notes
-Ensure that your webcam is properly connected and accessible.

-The model used for emotion detection is loaded from model.h5 file. Ensure that the correct path to this file is specified in the main.py script.

-Emotion labels are predefined in the emotion_labels list. Update this list as needed.

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter any issues, feel free to open an issue on GitHub or reach out to the project contributors.
